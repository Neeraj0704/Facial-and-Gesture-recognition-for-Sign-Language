##Facial and Gesture Recognition System
Overview
This project aims to create a real-time system that can simultaneously recognize facial expressions and sign language gestures. It leverages advanced deep learning models—EfficientNet for facial recognition and YOLOv5 for sign language detection—integrated within a single Python application. The system is designed to enhance human-computer interaction by interpreting emotions and gestures in real time.

Features
Facial Expression Recognition:

Detects and classifies facial expressions using the EfficientNet model.
Real-time processing of facial data captured through a webcam.
Supports multiple emotion categories, depending on the trained model.
Sign Language Gesture Recognition:

Recognizes various sign language gestures using the YOLOv5 model.
Processes video input in real time to identify specific gestures.
Customizable for different sets of gestures based on your dataset.
Integrated System:

Combines facial expression and sign language recognition in a unified script.
Real-time annotations and feedback displayed on the video stream.
Installation
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facial-gesture-recognition.git
cd facial-gesture-recognition
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download Models
EfficientNet Model: Place your trained EfficientNet model for facial recognition in the models/ directory.
YOLOv5 Model: Place your trained YOLOv5 model for sign language recognition in the models/ directory.
4. Setup YOLOv5
If you haven't already, you may need to set up YOLOv5:

bash
Copy code
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
1. Run the System
To start the real-time recognition system, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python real_time_recognition.py
2. Real-Time Detection
The system will access your default webcam to capture video input.
It will detect and classify facial expressions and sign language gestures in real time.
Detected emotions and gestures will be annotated on the video feed.
3. Exit the System
Press the q key to quit the application.

Customization
Facial Recognition: Modify the EfficientNet model architecture and preprocessing steps in real_time_recognition.py to suit your specific use case.
Sign Language Recognition: Update the YOLOv5 model configuration and classes to detect different gestures by retraining on a custom dataset.
